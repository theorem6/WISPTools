## ✅ Changes Committed and Pushed

- `e5ac3e9f` - Complete help system implementation and fixes

## 🚀 Deployment Options

### Option 1: Wait for GitHub Actions (Automatic)

GitHub Actions should automatically deploy when frontend files change. Check status:
1. Go to: https://github.com/theorem6/WISPTools/actions
2. Look for "Deploy to Firebase Hosting" workflow
3. It should have triggered from commits `233ab79e`, `5a6b940c`, or `e5ac3e9f`
4. Wait for it to complete (usually 5-10 minutes)

### Option 2: Manually Trigger GitHub Actions

1. Go to: https://github.com/theorem6/WISPTools/actions
2. Click on "Deploy to Firebase Hosting" workflow
3. Click "Run workflow" button
4. Select "main" branch
5. Click "Run workflow"
6. Wait for deployment to complete

### Option 3: Manual Firebase CLI Deployment

If you have Firebase CLI authenticated:

```powershell
cd C:\Users\david\Downloads\WISPTools\Module_Manager
npm run build
cd ..
firebase deploy --only hosting --project wisptools-production
```

**Note:** You'll need to run `firebase login --reauth` first if your credentials expired.

### Option 4: Check Current Deployment Status

1. Go to Firebase Console: https://console.firebase.google.com/project/wisptools-production/hosting
2. Check the latest deployment
3. See if it matches commit `233ab79e` or later

## 🔍 Verify Changes Are Live

After deployment completes:

1. **Hard refresh your browser:** `Ctrl + Shift + R` (Windows) or `Cmd + Shift + R` (Mac)
2. **Clear browser cache** if needed
3. **Check for help buttons:**
   - Coverage Map module - Fixed position help button (bottom right)
   - Inventory module - Fixed position help button (bottom right)
   - HSS Management module - Fixed position help button (bottom right)
   - CBRS Management module - Fixed position help button (bottom right)
4. **Test help modals:** Click help buttons to verify they open
5. **Test hardware modal:** Verify it doesn't create loops

## 📝 What Was Fixed

1. **Help buttons:** Now use fixed position circular buttons with SVG icons (matching PCI Resolution style)
2. **Hardware modal loop:** Fixed by removing `bind:show` and preventing show prop modification
3. **Event handlers:** Converted all `on:click` to `onclick` for consistency
4. **Build errors:** All syntax errors fixed, build passes successfully

## ⏱️ Expected Timeline

- **GitHub Actions:** 5-10 minutes after push
- **Manual deployment:** 3-5 minutes
- **Total:** Changes should be live within 10-15 minutes of push
